# How Entrepreneurs Can Unlock Their Full Potential

I've got this new definition of hell that 

I'm still testing out. 

My theory is 

this, that when we leave this earth, the vast 

majority of us are actually going to take the elevator up. 

But when we get there, whatever God 

we believe in is literally going to 

show us every single thing that was possible in our lives while on Earth 

had we only believed. 

See, 

our biggest regrets are never rooted in our actions or the things that we did do. 

It's in our inactions, the 

things that we did not do or even try. 

And it's usually because we didn't believe we could. 

I'm not good enough. 

I'm not smart enough. 

I'm not rich enough. 

I I didn't have time. 

Beliefs are generally formed by two 

things, either our experiences, 

our environment, our inference 

inferences, or our 

own deductions, or by 

accepting what other people tell us to be true. 

And most of our core beliefs are formed when we're children now. 

I was a horrible student. 

I was branded gifted in kindergarten. 

I was a really smart kid, but I 

hated school. 

But I was always enterprising. 

I was the kid, 

y'all, that 

used to make popsicles in the ice 

tray and sell them for a dime in my driveway. 

I was so cold with it, 

y'all, that I 

used to charge people 50 cents to fight in my 

backyard so they wouldn't get in trouble getting fighting in the front yard. 

And that is a true story. 

That is a true story. 

I love the transaction. 

And I was riding my bike to the barber shop one day. 

And I'll never forget this day. 

I was 11 years old riding my bike to the barber shop. 

And and you got to understand, when I 

grew up in the 80s, you could have put a Bentley next to a 

Ferrari and I would have taken a Ford 

Mustang GT everydayofthe  week. 

So as I pull up to the barber shop on my 

bike, I'm frozen in my tracks. 

I'm talking deer 

headlights. Why? 

Because? 

Oh 

my god, there it 

was a black on black on black convertible 

Mustang GT parked illegally in front of 

the barber shop, and I lost my mind. 

I ran into the barber shop and 

screamed, 

I'm a who's car is that? 

And so I see my barber in the corner of my eye, 

just chilling in the cut. 

Just then 

he gave me, the nod. 

That's the Universal Soul Brother symbol for 

that's me. 

And so because of my 

environment, 

my examples, my 

inferences, my deductions. 

There was only one thing that he could have possibly done to afford that car. 

And because it was so normalized in my community, I 

didn't think anything of it. 

So when I got in this chair, as a matter 

of fact, as 

I'm asking about the 

weather, I asked him. 

I said, John, I 

didn't know 

you were a dope boy. 

Click turned off the 

clippers, 

screamed at shut the f up and turn around and count how many chairs you see in this shop. 

Said, I don't 

know, 10. He said. 

Well, 

each one of these Barbers pays me $50 a week to cut hair in my shop. 

Jay, 

you're smart. 

Do to math. 

So little Jay Bailey, 

start tabulating. 

And he stopped me. 

He said, 

you got to realize I got two more shops just like this. 

Finish the math. 

So now things got interesting. 

Remember, 

this is the early'80s and I'm 

an 11-year old kid and I had never seen 

Zer like this. 

I was like z00. 

0 comma zero. 

And then he said it. 

He 

said, I am an entrepreneur. 

I own this 

business and I own those other two shops. 

And what you need to do is go find you something you love and go 

make money. 

Doing 

it to very powerful things happened in that one moment. 

For the first time in my life, I had ever 

heard the word entrepreneur, and it's what I had 

always been, but I didn't have a name for it. 

And so literally, 

once I started to understand what entrepreneur really meant, my 

life started to make sense and 

I had Direction. 

And the second thing was that nobody had ever explained to me the whole concept of ownership. 

And those two things fundamentally changed my trajectory. 

I can't understate or overstate the power of that 

chance encounter that lit a fire in the belly of an 11-year-old kid 

that became a 12-year-old business owner who now stands before you. 

Leading the largest sinner in the world 

dedicated to Growing, scaling 

and developing black 

businesses, touching thousands of entrepreneurs. 

Wow. 

And so for what we did there 

and for now, touching thousands of 

entrepreneurs, I knew that we lose GDP 

every year because the brilliant idea is to reside on the south side of the tracks of every city in America. 

Never reach the 

marketplace, cuz they don't believe they belong. 

And I'm also a firm believer that the only difference between that north side of the tracks and that south side of the tracks is access, 

opportunity and exposure. 

And that's it. 

You want to talk about Innovation? 

Show me somebody on the planet more Innovative than a single mother with two kids making $a year. 

The way she 

thinks, the way she problem solves her grit, 

her 

determination, her resilience. 

How is she able to smile and 

still spread joy to her kids at Christmas when 

there are no gifts under the tree and there is literally no food in the pantry? 

But somehow 

she still makes it work. 

How does she do it? 

In this example, 

she feels like a warrior, but what 

does she believe when she stares 

in the mirror? 

Drug dealers, I don't condone 

them, I don't celebrate them, but 

I did grow up around them, and I got tons of my 

friends that are twice as smart, twice as 

sharp, 10 times as 

charismatic as me. 

But they made different decisions and choices in life, and 

they came with severe outcomes. 

But I'm still enamored 

by them. Why? 

Cuz we can go to any Hood in 

America and find me the biggest, 

baddest dope boy on any block. 

And y'all are going to have to convince me that that kid doesn't understand. 

Import, export, 

wholesale, retail 

supply demand, 

customer retention, 

customer 

support 

loss prevention, all with a gun. 

Do his head 

and the cops and his competition. 

L Lally trying to eviscerate him from the equation every single day. 

What if that kid had different 

experiences, different exposure, 

different income inputs, 

better role models? 

If he did, he'd 

run circles around everybody. 

What was whispered in his ear that he 

believed, and what were the environments that he was placed in where he 

felt like he belonged? 

That's The Power of what we are trying to do with the Russell Center, because when I started to think about 

an opportunity to create this safe space, where 

literally I started 

to tap into the most powerful examples of economic mobility in our community's 

history, mtown and historically black colleges and 

universities, our HBCU. 

We wanted to be disruptive to the typical 

incubator accelerator model, because 

statistically they just haven't worked at scale for black entrepreneurs. 

And the thing about mtown and HBCU, 

the beautiful similarity is that you were surrounded by black Brilliance. 

Every single day. 

Your ideas mattered. 

You saw value in your own reflection, literally, 

you understood greatness at a 

higher level because you experienced it 

every moment of every waking minute. 

And so we got started. 

And you can read it in my bio that I 

have the high honor of leading the HJ Russell Innovation Center for entrepreneurs right here in Atlanta, 

Georgia, and honor of one of the greatest entrepreneurs this city has ever 

produced, Mr. HJ Russell. 

So when we started to think about HBCU in Motown and what made them so special, we thought what 

could make us so special and different? 

And so 

with our platform, we 

got started creating this, 

this space that was rooted in 

belonging, the undergirded self-esteem, self-

confidence and belief that literally 

looked at looking at the whole entrepreneur and not ignoring the loneliness, the depression, 

the isolation that goes along with any entrepreneurial Journey, but also 

making Wellness 

just as important as learning about a p&l or a balance sheet. 

In just four years from getting 

started, we support now 360 entrepreneurs full

-time that have created new jobs in our community. 

We Touch  annually through our network of Partners, and our 

stakeholder companies have generated over $450 million of New Economic value in our community. 

[Applause] [Music] 

we created the space where our ideas 

mattered and we had the freedom to believe. 

We created the space where 

we knew without a shadow of a doubt we belonged. 

And we're just getting started. 

I'll close with this. 

If you are 

black, 

brown, or a woman without 

ever having a single conversation with you 

individually, I can assume this to be true, that if 

you are black, brown, or a 

woman in some way, shape 

or form, you have heard the speech that you 

got to be twice as sharp, 

three times as smart, five 

times as perfect, just 

to sometimes 

compete with 

[Applause]. 

Mediocre. 

And so every day we put on the mask, every day we 

put on this heavy suit of armor to protect ourselves, and 

it gets so heavy. 

Never being able to show up as your true authentic self, never 

being able to take off that mask or take off that armor. 

And the world suffers because because of 

it, because the world never gets to meet the real you, the 

authentic you, the you that is 

brilliant, the you that is full of ideas, 

the you that is powerful 

that gets hidden every single day. 

So I'm asking each 

of you and 

finding this place, the you that gets hidden every 

single day, the power powerful you that never getss seen. 

Because guess what? 

There is a beautiful you that maybe even 

your best you, that 

you've never even met yourself. 

When we started this journey, there 

were no seats for us in these spaces, so 

we started to build our own. 

We had to surround our selves with the people and the places that allowed us to believe. 

We started to ignore these seeds of doubt and 

only started to plant 

seeds that would grow 

SE trees whose shade you may never sit under. 

Owning your space, 

believing in you, 

your best self, and 

introducing yourself to your best self. 

Because 

literally the world suffers every day. 

It does not have your full self in it. 

The best 

you, the real you. 

And we can't wait to meet you. 

Thank you.
